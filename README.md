# An Engineering Manager's hands-on primer

### Motivation
> When I started to apply for jobs like Senior Engineering Manager etc, I was totally lost on what the expectations 
> are in the market for an Engineering Manager. Most job descriptions are copy/paste with the line "Looking for 
> an hands on Manager", "looking for a code ninja", "should know how to design architecture end to end" etc. If they 
> are looking for a code ninja then why can't they hire an Engineer? If they want System Design then why not hire an
> Architect? So why do they ask these for an Enginering Manager? 
>
> How do you prepare when the last time you wrote a code or designed a system was 10-15 years ago? I am talking about 
> Engineering Managers in product companies handling large systems and people (> 10) for whom coding is not part of day to 
> day activity. 
>
> I struggled to find this information in the internet chaos; so I thought I will share it here for people like me.
