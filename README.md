# An Engineering Manager's hands-on primer

### Motivation
> When I started to apply for jobs like Senior Engineering Manager etc, I was totally lost on what the expectations 
> are in the market for an Engineering Manager. Most job descriptions are copy/paste with the line "Looking for 
> an hands on Manager", "looking for a code ninja" etc. So how do you prepare when the last time you wrote a code
> or designed a system was 10-15 years ago? I am talking about Engineering Managers in product companies handling
> large systems and people (> 10) for whom coding is not part of day to day activity. 
> I struggled to find in the internet chaos so I thought I will share it here for people like me.
